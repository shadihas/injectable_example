# injectable_example

This Flutter project showcases efficient use of `injectable`, `get_it`, and clean BLoC management. 

## Key Features 
- **Dependency Injection:**
  - Uses `injectable` and `get_it` for organized dependency injection.
  - Dependencies are generated via `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.

- **BLoC Management:**
  - BLoCs are seamlessly integrated application/services/screen.dart.
  - `using TResult when<TResult extends Object?>`.
